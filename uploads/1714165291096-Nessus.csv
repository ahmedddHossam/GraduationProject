SSH Server CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled,"The SSH server is configured to use Cipher Block Chaining.The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
encryption.  This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message
from the ciphertext. 

Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server and
does not check for vulnerable software versions.","Contact the vendor or consult product documentation to disable CBC mode
cipher encryption, and enable CTR or GCM cipher mode encryption.",,,,,SSH,10.91.1.15,22,Unknown,,Low,3,CVE-2008-5161,,Unauthenticated,Internal,,DSVA,04/17/2024,Nessus
SSH Weak MAC Algorithms Enabled,"The remote SSH server is configured to allow MD5 and 96-bit MAC
algorithms.The remote SSH server is configured to allow either MD5 or 96-bit MAC
algorithms, both of which are considered weak.
